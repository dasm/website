                <h1>Information gathering</h1>
<p>First and the most crucial phase of an engagement is information gathering. It helps to broaden surface of attack, and prepare for successful method of breaking into company.
Usually, people leave a lot of breadcrumbs around the Internet. Thanks to meticulous look up of the information, a lot of interesting details can be found.</p>
<h2>Interesting databases</h2>
<p>Given the vast array of social networks, it shouldn't be difficult to find interesting information. For example, user can create account on Twitter, point to Linkedin, Google and Facebook.</p>
<p>To find generic information, one might refer to twitter or google. For more work related information, usually better is Linkedin.</p>
<h3>Crunchbase</h3>
<p><a href="https://crunchbase.com">Crunchbase</a> is a platform for finding business information about private and public companies. It is a platform for finding business information about private and public companies. Additionally it contains useful information to match profiles.</p>
<h3>Government websites</h3>
<p>Some information can be found on official government websites. If a company is awarded contract.</p>
<h3>Whois</h3>
<p><code>whois</code> is command line tool, as well as <a href="https://www.whois.com/whois">website</a>. It allows to query the database of Internet addresses to get information about registrants of those addresses.</p>
<h3>COmpany website</h3>
<p>Oftentimes, interesting information can be found on company websites. We can find there information about products, customers, services, etc. Usually, there could be also find</p>
<h3>Email pattern</h3>
<p>Many companies have common email pattern. It usually means, that all employees, can be reached by some variation of email:</p>
<ul>
<li>first_name.last_name@company.com</li>
<li>last_name.first_name@company.com</li>
<li>first_letter__nameLast_name@company.com</li>
</ul>
<p>By accessing at least one of employees emails, you basically obtained all of them, as long as you know employee name.</p>
<p>To verify if chosen email is valid, one can send email and wait for response. Many email servers return message in the case of non-existing user.</p>
<h2>Subdomain enumeration</h2>
<p>It is common for a company, to have multiple different subdomains, like <code>email.company.com</code>, <code>blog.company.com</code>, <code>careers.company.com</code>. Sometimes, companies leave running vulnerable services. In that case, it could be much easier to exploit a bug on some outdated subdomain, than main domain.
There are several ways of achieving that goal.</p>
<h3>Google</h3>
<p>One of the simplest ways is to search a Google!
By issuing query to search engine like below, we can receive responses focused around particular company website.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">site</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="n">company</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">com</span>
</pre></div>


<h3>dnsdumpster</h3>
<p><a href="https://dnsdumpster.com/">DNSDumpster.com</a> is a free domain research tool that can discover hosts related to a domain. Finding visible hosts from the attackers perspective is an important part of the security assessment process.</p>
<h3>CLI Sublist3r</h3>
<p>Sublist3r is a python tool designed to enumerate subdomains of websites using OSINT. It helps penetration testers and bug hunters collect and gather subdomains for the domain they are targeting. Sublist3r enumerates subdomains using many search engines such as Google, Yahoo, Bing, Baidu and Ask. Sublist3r also enumerates subdomains using Netcraft, Virustotal, ThreatCrowd, DNSdumpster and ReverseDNS.</p>

                </h2>

                
                

                <h1>Basics</h1>
<p>During building web applications we need to focus on several fundamental aspects:</p>
<ol>
<li>HTTP Protocol Basics</li>
<li>Cookies</li>
<li>Sessions</li>
<li>Same Origin Policy</li>
</ol>
<h2>HTTP Protocol Basics</h2>
<p><code>HTTP</code> (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is the most used protocol on the Internet. Usually, the client (browser), connects to the server (<code>Apache</code>, <code>nginx</code>, <code>ISS</code>.
During an HTTP communication, the client and the server exchange messages. HTTP works on top of TCP. That means, first a TCP connection is established, and then the client sends its request, and waits for the answer. The server processes the request and sends back its answer, providing a status code and appropriate data.</p>
<h3>HTTP Request</h3>
<p>To send HTTP request, usually we use browsers. However, it is not the only way of doing so. To build request, we can use <code>netcat</code> or <code>telnet</code>.
Below is an example of HTTP request, with <code>nc</code> requesting website running on localhost on port <code>8000</code>.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>$ nc localhost 8000
GET / HTTP/1.0
Host: localhost

HTTP/1.0 200 OK
Server: SimpleHTTP/0.6 Python/3.7.3
Date: Fri, 02 Oct 2020 01:44:49 GMT
Content-type: text/html
Content-Length: 26612
Last-Modified: Fri, 02 Oct 2020 01:44:33 GMT

<span class="cp">&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</span>
[...]
</pre></div>


<p>First line contains <strong>HTTP request method</strong>, path and protocol version.
HTTP request method is information about the type of the request. Other requests are: <code>PUT</code>, <code>POST</code>, <code>HEAD</code>, etc. List of available metods can be found on <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods">Mozilla website</a>
Path tells the server which resource to fetch, while protocol version tells how to communicate with the client.
Next, there is <code>Host</code> header field, which specifies the Internet hostname and port number of the resource being requested.</p>
<p>We can also create one-liner to retrieve appropriate information</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>$ <span class="nb">echo</span> -en <span class="s1">&#39;HEAD / HTTP/1.1\r\nHost:localhost\r\n\r\n&#39;</span> <span class="p">|</span> nc localhost <span class="m">8000</span>
HTTP/1.0 <span class="m">200</span> OK
Server: SimpleHTTP/0.6 Python/3.7.3
Date: Fri, <span class="m">02</span> Oct <span class="m">2020</span> <span class="m">02</span>:01:34 GMT
Content-type: text/html
Content-Length: <span class="m">27806</span>
Last-Modified: Fri, <span class="m">02</span> Oct <span class="m">2020</span> <span class="m">01</span>:55:46 GMT
</pre></div>


<p>Additionally, we can give extra header values like <code>User-Agent</code> (identifies the client and the system), <code>Accept</code> (specifies document type the client is expecting in the response) or <code>Connection: keep-alive</code> (future communications with the server will reuse the current connection).</p>
<h3>HTTP Response</h3>
<p>HTTP response, similar to request, has common format.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>$ nc localhost 8000
GET / HTTP/1.0
Host: localhost

HTTP/1.0 200 OK
Server: SimpleHTTP/0.6 Python/3.7.3
Date: Fri, 02 Oct 2020 01:44:49 GMT
Content-type: text/html
Content-Length: 26612
Last-Modified: Fri, 02 Oct 2020 01:44:33 GMT

<span class="cp">&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</span>
[...]
</pre></div>


<p>The first line is <strong>Status-Line</strong> which consists of protocol version (HTTP 1.0) followed by a numeric status code (200) and textual meaning (OK). There are many codes. Description, again can be found on <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status">Mozilla website</a>. Next, there is additional information regarding server, date and time at which the message was originated, followed by page content.</p>
<h3>HTTP Secure (HTTPS)</h3>
<p>HTTP over SSL/TLS is a method to run clear-text HTTP with extra cryptographic protocol, to prevent from sniffing.
By doing so, entire traffic is being encrypted. It means, that even if someone can intercept traffic, they won't be able to see what kind of information is being transmitted. The only non-encrypted pieces of information would be:</p>
<ul>
<li>target IP address</li>
<li>target port</li>
<li>DNS or similar protocols (domain resolvers)</li>
</ul>
<p>To analyze connection, we cannot use <code>nc</code> anymore, which doesn't support SSL. To work with SSL, we can use <code>openssl</code></p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>$ nc blog.smigiel.dev <span class="m">443</span>
HEAD / HTTP/1.1
$
</pre></div>

<h2>HTTP Cookies</h2>
<p>HTTP is stateless protocol. It means, that website cannot keep the state of a visit across different HTTP requests. Every HTTP request is unrelated to others.
To change this situation, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_cookie">cookies</a> were introduced.</p>
<p>Cookies are textual information installed by a website into web browser. Server can set a cookie using <strong>Set-Cookie</strong> header field.</p>
<h3>Cookie fields</h3>
<p>Cookies are only sent to the valid domain and path when they are not expired and according to their flags.
The domain field and the path field set the scope of the cookie. The browser sends the cookie only if the request is for the right domain.
If the server does not specify domain attribute, the browser will automatically set the domain as the server domain and set the cookie <strong>host-only</strong> flag. It means that the cookie will be sent only to that precise hostname.</p>
<h3>Cookie protocol</h3>
<p>Cookies are usually set during a login. Browser sends <strong>POST</strong> request to the server, and the server responds with a <strong>Set-Cookie</strong> header field.
For every subsequent request, the browser considers domain, path, expiration and flags. If all checks pass, the browser will insert a <strong>cookie:</strong> header in the request.</p>
<h2>Sessions</h2>
<p>Sessions mechanism works similar to cookies. The difference here relies on the way how the information is stored. Session is kept on <em>server-side</em>. Each user session is identified by a <strong>session id</strong> which the server assigns to the user. The client then presents its <strong>ID</strong> for each subsequent request, thus being recognized by the server. The server retrieves the state of the client and all its associated variables.</p>
<h2>Same-Origin Policy (SOP)</h2>
<p>Same-Origin Policy prevents JavaScript code from getting or setting properties on a resource comming from a <strong>different origin</strong>. To determine if JavaScript can access a resource <em>hostname</em>, <em>port</em> and <em>protocol</em> must match.
SOP applies only to the actual code. It is still possible to include external resources by other HTML tags like <code>img</code>, <code>script</code>, <code>iframe</code>, <code>object</code>, etc.</p>

                <h1>Firewall</h1>
<p>Firewalls are specialized software modules running on a computer or a dedicated network device. They serve to filter packets coming in and out of a network. They can work on different layers of the OSI model.</p>
<h2>Packet filtering</h2>
<p>The most basic feature of a firewall is packet filtering. Administrator can create rules which will filter packets according to certain characteristics like:</p>
<ul>
<li>source IP address</li>
<li>destination IP address</li>
<li>protocol</li>
<li>source port</li>
<li>destination port</li>
</ul>
<p>Common actions, that can be applied:</p>
<ul>
<li>allow: allow the packet to pass</li>
<li>drop: drops the packet without any diagnostic message to the packet source host</li>
<li>deny: similar to drop, but notify the source host</li>
</ul>
<p>Inspecting the header of a packet does not give you any information on the content. Even if only port <code>80</code> or <code>443</code> is allowed, attacker can exploit them, to access deeper levels of network.</p>
<h2>Application level firewalls</h2>
<p>Application level firewall works by checking all 7 layers of the OSI model. They provide more comprehensive protection because they inspect the actual content of a packet, not just headers.</p>
<h2>Intrusion Detection System (IDS)</h2>
<p>IDS inspects the application payload trying to detect any potential attack. It checks for attack vectors like ping sweeps, port scans, SQL injections, buffer overflows etc.
IDS, similar to antivirus, detects risky traffic by means of signatures. The vendor provides frequent signature updates as soon as new attack vectors are found. Without the right signatures an IDS cannot detect and report an intrusion.
There is also risk of <strong>false positives</strong> when legic traffic is marked as malicious.</p>
<p><code>IDS != firewall</code>
IDS is another layer of protection, which can be used in conjunction with firewall.</p>
<h2>Intrusion Prevention System (IPS)</h2>
<p>It is similar to IDS, however it can drop malicious request when the threat has risk classification above predefined threshold.</p>
<h1>Domain Name System (DNS)</h1>
<p>The DNS converts human-readable names to IP addresses.
DNS structure can be broken down into:</p>
<ul>
<li>top level domain (TLD)</li>
<li>domain part</li>
<li>subdomain part (if applicable)</li>
<li>host part</li>
</ul>
<p>Name resolution is performed by resolvers. Resolvers are servers that contact the TLD server and follow the hierarchy of the DNS name to resolve the name of a host:</p>
<ol>
<li>resolver contacts one of the <strong>root name servers</strong>, these server contain information about the TLD (this information is hardcoded by system administrator);</li>
<li>next, it asks the TLD name server (from previous step), what's the name of the server which can give information about the <strong>domain</strong> the resolver is looking for;</li>
<li>if there are one or more subdomains, previous step is repeated for every subdomain;</li>
<li>resolver asks for the name resolution of the <strong>host</strong> part;</li>
<li>the resolver sends the IP address back to the client.</li>
</ol>

                <h1>TCP &amp; UDP</h1>
<p>There are two common transport protocols used on the Internet: <code>TCP</code> (Transmission Control Protocol) and <code>UDP</code> (User Datagram Protocol).
TCP is the most used transport protocol on the Internet. The vast majority of applications use it, and the IP protocol suite is often called <strong>TCP/IP</strong>.
UDP is much simpler. It doesn't guarantee packet delivery and it is conectionless. Thanks to those features, it is much faster than TCP, it provides better throughput. It is often used by multimedia applications that can tolerate packet loss but are througput intensive. It is often used in VoIP and video streaming applications where you can tolerate a little glitch in the audio or video.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>TCP</th>
<th>UDP</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Connection oriented protocol</td>
<td>Connectionless</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Rearranges data packets in the order specified</td>
<td>No inherent order as all packets are independent of each other.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Slower speed than UDP</td>
<td>UDP is faster, because error recovery is not attepmted. It is "best effort" protocol</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Data is read as byte stream, no distinguishing information is sent to signal message boundaries</td>
<td>Packets are sent individually and are checked for integrity only when they arrive. Packets have definite boundaries, meaning a read operation at the receiver socket will yield an entire message as it was originally sent.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<h2>Ports</h2>
<p>Ports are used to identify a single network process on a machine. When some process is establishing connection to external internet resource (browser -&gt; website), there is port open, associated with browser. Information about the port is later sent as part of header in TCP or UDP packet. In the case of aforementioned connection, <code>source port</code> would be the same, that was created for browser. <code>Destination port</code> then is associeated with website (usually <code>80</code> or <code>443</code>).
This is the way how process know where information needs to be addressed.</p>
<h2>TCP handshake</h2>
<p>In the case of UDP, which is connectionless, there is no handshake. However, for TCP, before any kind of transmission can happen, there needs to be established connection.
It is done in so called three-way handshake.
The header fields involved in the handshake are: sequence number, acknowledgement numbers, SYN and ACK flags</p>
<ol>
<li>The client sends a TCP packet to the server with the <code>SYN</code> flag enabled and a random <code>sequence number</code>.</li>
<li>The server replies by sending a packet with both the <code>SYN</code> and <code>ACK</code> flags. <code>Sequence number</code> is again chosen as random, but <code>ACK</code> is <code>seq number + 1</code>.</li>
<li>The client completes the synchronization by sending an <code>ACK</code> packet. The <code>ACK</code> is <code>seq number + 1</code> and <code>sequence number</code> is <code>ACK + 1</code> from the second step.</li>
</ol>

                <h1>Routing</h1>
<p>A router is a networking device that forwards data packets between computer networks. A router os connected to two or more data lines from different IP networks. When a data packet comes in one of the lines, the router reads the network address information in the packet header to determine the destination. Then, based on routing table, it directs the packet to the next network.
Routing table contains information about the topology of the network immediately around it.
The table can also contain an entry with the <strong>default address</strong> <code>0.0.0.0</code>. This entry is used when the router receives a packet whose destination is an <em>unknown network</em>.</p>
<h2>Routing table example (router)</h2>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="err">Kernel IP routing table</span>

<p>The kernel reads routing table from the top down. The first column is the destination. The second column tells how to reach that destination.
The default gateway is always shown with the destination <code>0.0.0.0</code>. The IP address in the gateway column is that of the outbound gateway router. The netmask for the default gateway means that any packet not addressed to the local network or another outbound router by additional entries in the routing table are to be sent to the default gateway regardless of the network class.</p>
<h1>Networking Layer 2</h1>
<p>Every host on a network has both an IP and a MAC address. When server A wants to send a packet to server B:</p>
<ol>
<li>server A creates a packet:<ul>
<li>the destination IP address of server B in the IP header of the datagram.</li>
<li>the destination MAC address of the router in the link layer header of the frame.</li>
<li>the source IP address of the server A.</li>
<li>the source MAC address of the server A.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>router takes a packet and forwards it to server B (the destination MAC address is the MAC address of the <strong>next hop</strong>):<ul>
<li>the destination MAC address is rewritten to server B</li>
<li>the source MAC address is of router.</li>
<li><strong>Only MAC address is changed. IP address stays the same (both source and destination)</strong>. This is global information and remains the same along the packet trip.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>MAC address</h2>
<p>MAC address is a unique identifier assigned to a network interface controller (NIC). It is assigned by device manufacturer: typically includes a manufacturer's organizationally unique identifier. MAC address is 48 bit (6 bytes) long and is expressed in hexadecimal form: <code>AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF</code>.</p>
<p>The IEEE has built in special address to allow more than one NIC to be addressed at one time. It's called broadcast address: <code>FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF</code>. Frame with this address is delivered to all devices in the local network.</p>
<h2>Network segmentation</h2>
<p>Switches do not segment networks. Only routers do so. Usually, every interface of a router is connected to different network. This is the reason, why routers <strong>do not forward broadcast packets</strong>, like switches.</p>
<h2>Packet forwarding</h2>
<p>To forward a packet:</p>
<ul>
<li>the switch reads the destination MAC address of the frame.</li>
<li>it performs a look-up in the CAM table.</li>
<li>it forwads the packet to the corresponding interface.</li>
<li>if there is no entry with the MAC address, the switch will forward the frame to all its interfaces.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Address Resolution Protocol (ARP)</h2>
<p>The ARP is a communication protocol used for discovering the link layer address, such as a MAC address, associated with a given internet layer address, typically an IPv4 address.</p>
<h3>Example of workflow</h3>
<p>Two computers are connected to the same local network. Computer A wants to send packet to Computer B. Through DNS, it determines Computer B <strong>IP address</strong> <code>192.168.0.2</code>.
To send message, Computer A also requires MAC address.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Computer A retrieves cached information from ARP table for <code>192.168.0.2</code></p>
<ul>
<li>if the cache didn't produce a result for IP address, Computer A sends broadcast ARP request message <code>FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF</code>, requesting an answer for <code>192.168.0.2</code>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Based on retrieved information, Computer A sends packet with MAC adress and IP address.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>ARP table has time-to-live (TTL) for every entry. When it expires, or on power off, host discards entries.</p>
