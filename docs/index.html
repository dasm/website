                <h1>Firewall</h1>
<p>Firewalls are specialized software modules running on a computer or a dedicated network device. They serve to filter packets coming in and out of a network. They can work on different layers of the OSI model.</p>
<h2>Packet filtering</h2>
<p>The most basic feature of a firewall is packet filtering. Administrator can create rules which will filter packets according to certain characteristics like:</p>
<ul>
<li>source IP address</li>
<li>destination IP address</li>
<li>protocol</li>
<li>source port</li>
<li>destination port</li>
</ul>
<p>Common actions, that can be applied:</p>
<ul>
<li>allow: allow the packet to pass</li>
<li>drop: drops the packet without any diagnostic message to the packet source host</li>
<li>deny: similar to drop, but notify the source host</li>
</ul>
<p>Inspecting the header of a packet does not give you any information on the content. Even if only port <code>80</code> or <code>443</code> is allowed, attacker can exploit them, to access deeper levels of network.</p>
<h2>Application level firewalls</h2>
<p>Application level firewall works by checking all 7 layers of the OSI model. They provide more comprehensive protection because they inspect the actual content of a packet, not just headers.</p>
<h2>Intrusion Detection System (IDS)</h2>
<p>IDS inspects the application payload trying to detect any potential attack. It checks for attack vectors like ping sweeps, port scans, SQL injections, buffer overflows etc.
IDS, similar to antivirus, detects risky traffic by means of signatures. The vendor provides frequent signature updates as soon as new attack vectors are found. Without the right signatures an IDS cannot detect and report an intrusion.
There is also risk of <strong>false positives</strong> when legic traffic is marked as malicious.</p>
<p><code>IDS != firewall</code>
IDS is another layer of protection, which can be used in conjunction with firewall.</p>
<h2>Intrusion Prevention System (IPS)</h2>
<p>It is similar to IDS, however it can drop malicious request when the threat has risk classification above predefined threshold.</p>
<h1>Domain Name System (DNS)</h1>
<p>The DNS converts human-readable names to IP addresses.
DNS structure can be broken down into:</p>
<ul>
<li>top level domain (TLD)</li>
<li>domain part</li>
<li>subdomain part (if applicable)</li>
<li>host part</li>
</ul>
<p>Name resolution is performed by resolvers. Resolvers are servers that contact the TLD server and follow the hierarchy of the DNS name to resolve the name of a host:</p>
<ol>
<li>resolver contacts one of the <strong>root name servers</strong>, these server contain information about the TLD (this information is hardcoded by system administrator);</li>
<li>next, it asks the TLD name server (from previous step), what's the name of the server which can give information about the <strong>domain</strong> the resolver is looking for;</li>
<li>if there are one or more subdomains, previous step is repeated for every subdomain;</li>
<li>resolver asks for the name resolution of the <strong>host</strong> part;</li>
<li>the resolver sends the IP address back to the client.</li>
</ol>

                <h1>TCP &amp; UDP</h1>
<p>There are two common transport protocols used on the Internet: <code>TCP</code> (Transmission Control Protocol) and <code>UDP</code> (User Datagram Protocol).
TCP is the most used transport protocol on the Internet. The vast majority of applications use it, and the IP protocol suite is often called <strong>TCP/IP</strong>.
UDP is much simpler. It doesn't guarantee packet delivery and it is conectionless. Thanks to those features, it is much faster than TCP, it provides better throughput. It is often used by multimedia applications that can tolerate packet loss but are througput intensive. It is often used in VoIP and video streaming applications where you can tolerate a little glitch in the audio or video.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>TCP</th>
<th>UDP</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Connection oriented protocol</td>
<td>Connectionless</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Rearranges data packets in the order specified</td>
<td>No inherent order as all packets are independent of each other.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Slower speed than UDP</td>
<td>UDP is faster, because error recovery is not attepmted. It is "best effort" protocol</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Data is read as byte stream, no distinguishing information is sent to signal message boundaries</td>
<td>Packets are sent individually and are checked for integrity only when they arrive. Packets have definite boundaries, meaning a read operation at the receiver socket will yield an entire message as it was originally sent.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<h2>Ports</h2>
<p>Ports are used to identify a single network process on a machine. When some process is establishing connection to external internet resource (browser -&gt; website), there is port open, associated with browser. Information about the port is later sent as part of header in TCP or UDP packet. In the case of aforementioned connection, <code>source port</code> would be the same, that was created for browser. <code>Destination port</code> then is associeated with website (usually <code>80</code> or <code>443</code>).
This is the way how process know where information needs to be addressed.</p>
<h2>TCP handshake</h2>
<p>In the case of UDP, which is connectionless, there is no handshake. However, for TCP, before any kind of transmission can happen, there needs to be established connection.
It is done in so called three-way handshake.
The header fields involved in the handshake are: sequence number, acknowledgement numbers, SYN and ACK flags</p>
<ol>
<li>The client sends a TCP packet to the server with the <code>SYN</code> flag enabled and a random <code>sequence number</code>.</li>
<li>The server replies by sending a packet with both the <code>SYN</code> and <code>ACK</code> flags. <code>Sequence number</code> is again chosen as random, but <code>ACK</code> is <code>seq number + 1</code>.</li>
<li>The client completes the synchronization by sending an <code>ACK</code> packet. The <code>ACK</code> is <code>seq number + 1</code> and <code>sequence number</code> is <code>ACK + 1</code> from the second step.</li>
</ol>

                <h1>Routing</h1>
<p>A router is a networking device that forwards data packets between computer networks. A router os connected to two or more data lines from different IP networks. When a data packet comes in one of the lines, the router reads the network address information in the packet header to determine the destination. Then, based on routing table, it directs the packet to the next network.
Routing table contains information about the topology of the network immediately around it.
The table can also contain an entry with the <strong>default address</strong> <code>0.0.0.0</code>. This entry is used when the router receives a packet whose destination is an <em>unknown network</em>.</p>
<h2>Routing table example (router)</h2>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="err">Kernel IP routing table</span>
<span class="err">Destination     Gateway         Genmask         Flags   MSS Window  irtt Iface</span>

<span class="err">87.169.144.0    0.0.0.0         255.255.252.0   U         0 0          0 eth0</span>
<span class="err">127.0.0.0       0.0.0.0         255.0.0.0       U         0 0          0 lo</span>
<span class="err">0.0.0.0         87.169.144.1    0.0.0.0         UG        0 0          0 eth0</span>
</pre></div>


<p>The kernel reads routing table from the top down. The first column is the destination. The second column tells how to reach that destination.
The default gateway is always shown with the destination <code>0.0.0.0</code>. The IP address in the gateway column is that of the outbound gateway router. The netmask for the default gateway means that any packet not addressed to the local network or another outbound router by additional entries in the routing table are to be sent to the default gateway regardless of the network class.</p>
<h1>Networking Layer 2</h1>
<p>Every host on a network has both an IP and a MAC address. When server A wants to send a packet to server B:</p>
<ol>
<li>server A creates a packet:<ul>
<li>the destination IP address of server B in the IP header of the datagram.</li>
<li>the destination MAC address of the router in the link layer header of the frame.</li>
<li>the source IP address of the server A.</li>
<li>the source MAC address of the server A.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>router takes a packet and forwards it to server B (the destination MAC address is the MAC address of the <strong>next hop</strong>):<ul>
<li>the destination MAC address is rewritten to server B</li>
<li>the source MAC address is of router.</li>
<li><strong>Only MAC address is changed. IP address stays the same (both source and destination)</strong>. This is global information and remains the same along the packet trip.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>MAC address</h2>
<p>MAC address is a unique identifier assigned to a network interface controller (NIC). It is assigned by device manufacturer: typically includes a manufacturer's organizationally unique identifier. MAC address is 48 bit (6 bytes) long and is expressed in hexadecimal form: <code>AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF</code>.</p>
<p>The IEEE has built in special address to allow more than one NIC to be addressed at one time. It's called broadcast address: <code>FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF</code>. Frame with this address is delivered to all devices in the local network.</p>
<h2>Network segmentation</h2>
<p>Switches do not segment networks. Only routers do so. Usually, every interface of a router is connected to different network. This is the reason, why routers <strong>do not forward broadcast packets</strong>, like switches.</p>
<h2>Packet forwarding</h2>
<p>To forward a packet:</p>
<ul>
<li>the switch reads the destination MAC address of the frame.</li>
<li>it performs a look-up in the CAM table.</li>
<li>it forwads the packet to the corresponding interface.</li>
<li>if there is no entry with the MAC address, the switch will forward the frame to all its interfaces.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Address Resolution Protocol (ARP)</h2>
<p>The ARP is a communication protocol used for discovering the link layer address, such as a MAC address, associated with a given internet layer address, typically an IPv4 address.</p>
<h3>Example of workflow</h3>
<p>Two computers are connected to the same local network. Computer A wants to send packet to Computer B. Through DNS, it determines Computer B <strong>IP address</strong> <code>192.168.0.2</code>.
To send message, Computer A also requires MAC address.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Computer A retrieves cached information from ARP table for <code>192.168.0.2</code></p>
<ul>
<li>if the cache didn't produce a result for IP address, Computer A sends broadcast ARP request message <code>FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF</code>, requesting an answer for <code>192.168.0.2</code>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Based on retrieved information, Computer A sends packet with MAC adress and IP address.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>ARP table has time-to-live (TTL) for every entry. When it expires, or on power off, host discards entries.</p>

                <h1>Protocols</h1>
<h2>What is packet</h2>
<p>Every packet in every protocol has <code>Header</code> (control information) and <code>Payload</code> (user data) structure. The header has a protocol-specific structure: this ensures that the receiving host can correctly interpret the payload and handle the communication. The payload is the actual information. It could be something like part of an email message or the content of a file during a download.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv4_packet#Header">IPv4 protocol header</a> is at least 160 bits (20 bytes) long, and it includes 14 fields, of which 13 are required. Last field, called <code>options</code> is optional.
<img alt="IPv4 packet - Wikipedia" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/71/IPv4_Packet_-en.svg">
Source: Wikipedia, author <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:MichelBakni&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1">MichelBakni</a></p>
<p>Using the information in the header, the nodes involved in the communication can understand and use IP packets.</p>
<h2>Protocol layers</h2>
<p>Most of the time, when people talk about layers, they think about OSI model. OSI model promoted the idea of a consistent model of protocol layers, defining interoperability between network devices and software.
Based on that we can think about seven layers (<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/network/windows-network-architecture-and-the-osi-model">more here</a>).  What we need to know is, that each protocol has <code>header</code> and <code>payload</code>. It goes from top to bottom. Every next layer is encapsulating the layer before in the form of payload.</p>
<h2>Encapsulation</h2>
<p>If we look from 10.000 foot perspective, we can see only data packet. However, if we look at this closer, it's starting showing some interesting properties.
Every layer contains paylod in a form of <code>header+payload</code> from previous layer. It means, that at the lowest level, we're looking at</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">header</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">header</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">header</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">header</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="n">payload</span><span class="p">))))</span>
</pre></div>


<p>This kind of behavior happens to every packet sent by host. On the other side of pipeline, receiving host, needs to unpack all the information, with regards to correct layers.</p>
<h1>Internet Protocol (IP)</h1>
<h2>IP Address</h2>
<h3>IPv4 Address</h3>
<p>IPv4 address consists of 4 bytes (octets). A dot delimits every octet in the address. Each byte (<code>2^8</code>) can represent value <strong>0</strong> to <strong>255</strong>.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="err"> 172.22.128.47</span>
</pre></div>


<h4>Special use IPv4 addresses</h4>
<p>RFC5735 describes IPv4 addresses, which cannot be assigned to host, due to its special use case.
Common addresses, that are in use:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="err">127.0.0.0/8    &lt;-- host loopback address.</span>
<span class="err">169.254.0.0/16 &lt;-- communication between hosts, without DHCP server cannot be found.</span>
<span class="err">192.168.0.0/16 &lt;-- private networks.</span>
</pre></div>


<h3>Network classes</h3>
<p>Internet addresses are allocated by the InterNIC organization. The most common classes are A, B and C. D and E exist, but are not used by end users.
Each of classes has different default subnet mask.</p>
<ul>
<li>Class A: uses 255.0.0.0 (CIDR /8) and have <code>0-127</code> as first octet,</li>
<li>Class B: uses 255.255.0.0 (CIDR /16) and have <code>128-191</code> as first octet,</li>
<li>Class C: uses 255.255.255.0 (CIDR /24) and have <code>192-223</code> as first octet.</li>
<li>Class D: range <code>224-239</code> as first octet, used for multicasting</li>
<li>Class E: range <code>240-255</code> as first octet, not available for general use, reserved for research purposes.</li>
</ul>
<h3>CIDR</h3>
<p>Subnet with all zeros is reserved for the referring to the network itself, while last address, all ones is used as broadcast address for the network. It means, that from network, two addresses are unavailable. In the world of CIDR, <code>/31</code> and <code>/32</code>, would be unusable, due to above requirement. That's why <code>RFC3021</code> created an exception. Network <code>/31</code> is usable for point-to-point links, while <code>/32</code> (single-host network) must be accessed by explicit routing rules, as there is no room in such a network for a gateway.</p>
<h3>IPv6</h3>
<p>RFC3513 (obsolete now) and RFC4291 describes IPv6 addressing architecture. This version allows to address 2^128 devices (approximately 3.4*10^38). It's been introduced in December 1995, but still majority of Internet relies on IPv4.
IPv6 is divided into two parts (each 64 bits): network identifier and interface identifier. Furthermore, the first 64 bits ends with a dedicated 16-bits space that can be used only for specifying a subnet.</p>

<p>Additionally, exists <em>EIP</em> (Instruction Pointer) which controls the program execution. It contains the address of the <strong>next</strong> instruction to be exetucted (it tells the CPU where the next instruction is).</p>
<h1>Program Memory</h1>
<p>Running process is usually organized in 2 sections: read-only and read/write.</p>
<ul>
<li>.text - address space where program's executable instructions is stored.</li>
<li>.data - global and static variables which have pre-defined value and can be modified.</li>
<li>BSS (Block Started by Symbol) - uninitialized data, is usually adjacent to .data segment. Contains all global and static variables which are initialized to zero or do not have specific explicit initialization in source code.</li>
<li>Heap - area commonly begins at the end of BSS and .data segments. and grows to larger addresses from there. This area is managed by <em>malloc</em>, <em>realloc</em> and <em>free</em>. This area is shared by all threads, shared libraries, and dynamically loaded modules in a process.</li>
<li>Stack - typically located in the higher parts of memory. ESP tracks the top of the stack.</li>
</ul>
<p>Heap grows towards higher memory addresses. Stack grows towards lower memory addresses.</p>
<p>Lower address | .text | .data | BSS | Heap -&gt; ... &lt;- Stack | Higher address</p>
<h2>Stack</h2>
<p>The Stack is Last-in First-out (<strong>LIFO</strong>). It is array for saving addresses, passing function arguments, and storing local variables.
There are two operations <em>PUSH/POP</em> to work with stack. With each operation, <em>ESP</em> is updated. Because stack grows towards lower addresses of memory, when we <em>PUSH</em> something on stack, stack pointer is reduced <code>ESP-4</code> (-4 for 32 bits, -8 for 64 bits). When we remove something from stack by <em>POP</em>ing it, ESP changes address again <code>ESP+4</code>.</p>
<p><em>PUSH</em>ed data is written to the stack memory, and later ESP address is updated <code>ESP-4</code>.
<em>POP</em>ped data is read from the stack and written to given register <code>POP EAX</code></p>
<p>Values <em>POP</em>ed from stack are not deleted/removed. They stay in stack until another instruction overwrites it.</p>
