Hey, I'm Dariusz. I'm cybersecurity wannabe.
This is an attempt to document my road to understand quirks of this world.

Let me say it loud and clear. I don't like doing stuff "easy way". It is not something that I should be proud of. What I mean by that? I mean, that instead of starting writing, producing some content, I'm spending my time looking for "right" tool, "correct" template or anything like that. From the very beginning, blog layout needs to be pixel-perfect. There is no place for mistake. Everything needs to be perfect. But, can it be done differently?

This is an attempt do it "new way". Instead of waiting, thinking, designing... let's produce some content.
Later, I can refine that. When time permits.
